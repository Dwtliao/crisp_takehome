## 📍 Act 1: Setup & Search

### Talking Points:
- "Let me search Evanston, IL - a real Chicago suburb with diverse restaurants"
- "GPS location works on mobile, but I'll use address search for the demo"
- "The system searches a 2.5km walking radius - about 20 minutes of walking"

### What to Show:
1. Enter "Evanston, IL" in address field
2. Click "Search This Address"
3. Point to loading indicator
4. **Highlight the filtering stats when results appear:**
   - "Found 18 prospects (sorted by distance)"
   - "6 filtered, 3 previously rejected"
   - "🧠 45 restaurants in rejection memory"

### Key Message:
"Before Hillary even looks, the system has already eliminated 9 bad prospects. That's 9 fewer doors to knock on in winter."

## 🛡️ Act 2: Business Rules in Action - The Oceanique Example

### The Star of This Demo: Oceanique Restaurant

**Why Oceanique is Perfect:**
- Real Evanston fine-dining restaurant
- Name sounds French ("Oceanique" = ocean-themed)
- **BUT: It's actually Asian-fusion seafood**
- System catches this BEFORE generating expensive pitch
- Demonstrates intelligent pre-filtering

### Talking Points:

**Setup:**
"Let me click on Oceanique - notice the name sounds French, which would normally be a good cheese pairing."

**The Warning Appears:**
"But look - the system detected this might be Asian cuisine BEFORE spending $0.05 on API calls to generate a pitch."

**What to Highlight:**
1. **Yellow warning box** with ⚠️ icon
2. **Confidence level:** "high" or "medium"
3. **Specific reasons shown:**
   - "Restaurant type: Asian, Seafood"
   - "Menu mentions: sushi, ramen, miso" (example)
4. **Cost savings message:**
   - "⚠️ This appears to be an Asian cuisine restaurant..."
   - "💰 Skipping pitch generation saved $0.05 in API costs"

**Two Options Presented:**
1. ❌ "Not Interested - Remember This"
   - "This adds to rejection memory permanently"
   - "Hillary will never see Oceanique again in future searches"
2. 📋 "Generate Pitch Anyway"
   - "Maybe it's fusion with cheese potential?"
   - "Hillary can override - we trust her judgment"

**Click Override:**
"Let me override to show the system respects Hillary's expertise. Maybe she knows something the AI doesn't."

**Pitch Generates Normally:**
- Full sales pitch appears
- All features work (TTS, voice notes, etc.)

### Key Message:
"This is the THREE-LAYER DEFENSE system:
- **Layer 1:** Backend filters out obvious Asian restaurants (Royal Thai, Siam Paragon - never appear)
- **Layer 2:** Rejection memory blocks previously rejected restaurants
- **Layer 3:** Pre-pitch detection catches edge cases like Oceanique
- **Result:** Hillary only knocks on high-probability doors"

### Business Rules Highlighted:
"The system filters for restaurants that pair with high-end cheese:
- ✅ Fine dining, steakhouses, European cuisine
- ✅ $20+ entrees (can afford $40/lb cheese)
- ❌ Asian cuisine (dairy doesn't pair)
- ❌ Fast food chains (McDonald's, Chipotle)
- ❌ Fast casual (cafes, bagel shops)
- ❌ Pizza chains (already have cheese suppliers)"

## 🧀 Act 3: AI-Powered Sales Pitch

### Pick a Good Restaurant (Not Oceanique):
**Suggested:** Look for "Prairie Moon" or "Found Kitchen" (real Evanston fine-dining)

### Talking Points:

**Click "View Pitch":**
"Watch what happens - the system is analyzing their actual menu right now."

**Loading Sequence:**
1. Calls Google Places API ($0.032)
2. Claude analyzes menu from reviews

   - "Hillary can reference specific dishes when talking to the chef"

4. **✨ Key Talking Points**
   - "Conversation topics about their cuisine style"
   - "Builds rapport before talking price"

5. **🏆 Competitive Advantage**

   - "Small-batch, local story, unique flavors"

6. **📞 Call to Action**

## 💾 Act 5: Persistence Demo - The Proof

### Setup:
"Now let me prove these notes aren't just session data. I'm going to shut down the server completely."

### What to Show:

**Step 1: Show Current Notes**
- Scroll to voice notes section
- "See these two notes we just recorded"

**Step 2: Exit the App**
- Go back to terminal
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
- "Server is completely down"

**Step 3: Restart Everything**
```bash
./start_app.sh
```
- "Fresh server start - no data in memory"

**Step 4: Navigate Back to Same Restaurant**
- Search "Evanston, IL" again
- Find the same restaurant (Prairie Moon or whichever you used)
- Click "View Pitch"
- Scroll to "📝 Notes" section

**Step 5: The Magic Moment**
- **"Look - our voice notes are still here!"**
- Same timestamps
- Same transcriptions
- Nothing lost

### Talking Points:

"This is localStorage in action:
- Notes saved in the browser, not the server
- Survives server restarts
- Survives browser restarts
- Survives computer restarts
- Only clears if Hillary explicitly clears browser data

This means Hillary can visit 20 restaurants Monday, come back Friday, and her notes are still there. Long-term follow-up tracking built-in."

### Key Message:
"This isn't a toy demo feature. This is production-grade persistence using browser native storage. Zero infrastructure cost."

## 💡 Closing Talking Points

### Business Value Summary:
"Let's talk ROI:
- **Time saved:** Hillary doesn't waste visits on incompatible restaurants
- **Money saved:** $0.05 per avoided pitch (Asian detection)
- **Better outcomes:** Contextual pitches based on real menu data
- **Long-term memory:** Voice notes + rejection learning compound over time

This isn't AI for AI's sake. This is AI solving a real cold-weather problem for a real cheese business."

### Technical Sophistication Hidden Behind Simplicity:
"Under the hood:
- 3-layer filtering system (backend keywords, rejection memory, pre-pitch detection)
- Claude Haiku for fast filtering ($0.001)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 for pitch generation ($0.02)
- Google Places for menu data ($0.032)
- Web Speech API for free TTS and voice notes
- localStorage for zero-infrastructure persistence

**Total cost per qualified prospect: ~$0.05**"

### What We'd Improve Next:
"Week 1 priorities if Hillary starts using this:
1. Route optimization - sort by walking distance from current location
2. Success tracking - mark which pitches converted to sales
3. Batch overnight - pre-generate pitches for tomorrow's planned route

Month 1:
- Semantic filtering - embeddings to catch more edge cases
- Collaborative learning - share rejection data across reps
- Export to CSV - share prospect list with team

This is an MVP that works today, with a clear roadmap for scaling when the business proves the model."

## 🎤 Suggested Voice Note Examples

Use realistic, business-focused content:

**Successful Visit:**
- "Spoke with head chef Sarah, she loved the Pasture Bloom sample, placing initial order Monday for 5 pounds"

**Follow-Up Needed:**
- "Manager out sick, front desk said come back next Tuesday between 2 and 4 PM"

**Rejection (Useful Data):**
- "Already locked into contract with Sysco, expires in 6 months, follow up in May"

**Menu Feedback:**
- "Kitchen says they need harder cheeses for grating, pitch Smoky Alder not Pasture Bloom"

**Competitive Intel:**
- "Currently using Carr Valley cheddar, complaints about inconsistent quality, opportunity here"
