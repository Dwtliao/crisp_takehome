---

## 🎬 Demo Script Overview

### Act 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

"Hands-free operation for winter walking routes."

### Act 5: Persistence Demo (1 minute)
"Data survives restarts - Hillary's notes are never lost."

---

## 📍 Act 1: Setup & Search

### Talking Points:
- "Let me search Evanston, IL - a real Chicago suburb with diverse restaurants"
- "GPS location works on mobile, but I'll use address search for the demo"
- "The system searches a 2.5km walking radius - about 20 minutes of walking"

### What to Show:
1. Enter "Evanston, IL" in address field
2. Click "Search This Address"
3. Point to loading indicator
4. **Highlight the filtering stats when results appear:**
   - "Found 18 prospects (sorted by distance)"
   - "6 filtered, 3 previously rejected"
   - "🧠 45 restaurants in rejection memory"

### Key Message:
"Before Hillary even looks, the system has already eliminated 9 bad prospects. That's 9 fewer doors to knock on in winter."

---

## 🛡️ Act 2: Business Rules in Action - The Oceanique Example

### The Star of This Demo: Oceanique Restaurant

**Why Oceanique is Perfect:**
- Real Evanston fine-dining restaurant
- Name sounds French ("Oceanique" = ocean-themed)
- **BUT: It's actually Asian-fusion seafood**
- System catches this BEFORE generating expensive pitch
- Demonstrates intelligent pre-filtering

### Talking Points:

**Setup:**
"Let me click on Oceanique - notice the name sounds French, which would normally be a good cheese pairing."

**The Warning Appears:**
"But look - the system detected this might be Asian cuisine BEFORE spending $0.05 on API calls to generate a pitch."

**What to Highlight:**
1. **Yellow warning box** with ⚠️ icon
2. **Confidence level:** "high" or "medium"
3. **Specific reasons shown:**
   - "Restaurant type: Asian, Seafood"
   - "Menu mentions: sushi, ramen, miso" (example)
4. **Cost savings message:**
   - "⚠️ This appears to be an Asian cuisine restaurant..."
   - "💰 Skipping pitch generation saved $0.05 in API costs"

**Two Options Presented:**
1. ❌ "Not Interested - Remember This"
   - "This adds to rejection memory permanently"
   - "Hillary will never see Oceanique again in future searches"
2. 📋 "Generate Pitch Anyway"
   - "Maybe it's fusion with cheese potential?"
   - "Hillary can override - we trust her judgment"

**Click Override:**
"Let me override to show the system respects Hillary's expertise. Maybe she knows something the AI doesn't."

**Pitch Generates Normally:**
- Full sales pitch appears
- All features work (TTS, voice notes, etc.)

### Key Message:
"This is the THREE-LAYER DEFENSE system:
- **Layer 1:** Backend filters out obvious Asian restaurants (Royal Thai, Siam Paragon - never appear)
- **Layer 2:** Rejection memory blocks previously rejected restaurants
- **Layer 3:** Pre-pitch detection catches edge cases like Oceanique
- **Result:** Hillary only knocks on high-probability doors"

### Business Rules Highlighted:
"The system filters for restaurants that pair with high-end cheese:
- ✅ Fine dining, steakhouses, European cuisine
- ✅ $20+ entrees (can afford $40/lb cheese)
- ❌ Asian cuisine (dairy doesn't pair)
- ❌ Fast food chains (McDonald's, Chipotle)
- ❌ Fast casual (cafes, bagel shops)
- ❌ Pizza chains (already have cheese suppliers)"

## 🧀 Act 3: AI-Powered Sales Pitch

### Pick a Good Restaurant (Not Oceanique):
**Suggested:** Look for "Prairie Moon" or "Found Kitchen" (real Evanston fine-dining)

### Talking Points:

**Click "View Pitch":**
"Watch what happens - the system is analyzing their actual menu right now."

**Loading Sequence:**
1. Calls Google Places API ($0.032)
2. Claude analyzes menu from reviews
3. Matches cheese to specific dishes
4. Generates customized pitch (~$0.02)
5. **Total cost: $0.053 per qualified prospect**

**What to Highlight in the Pitch:**

1. **🧀 Recommended Product**
   - "Notice it picked a specific cheese from the catalog"
   - "Pasture Bloom or Smoky Alder - not generic"

2. **💬 Opening Hook**
   - "A natural conversation starter tailored to this restaurant"
   - "Not a script - contextual to their style"

3. **🍽️ Menu Pairing Ideas**
   - **THIS IS THE MAGIC:** "Look - it found actual dishes from their menu"
   - "Pan-seared scallops with Pasture Bloom butter"
   - "These are REAL menu items, not generic suggestions"
   - "Hillary can reference specific dishes when talking to the chef"

4. **✨ Key Talking Points**
   - "Conversation topics about their cuisine style"
   - "Builds rapport before talking price"

5. **🏆 Competitive Advantage**
   - "Why Happy Pastures vs commodity cheese"
   - "Small-batch, local story, unique flavors"

6. **📞 Call to Action**
   - "How to close: sample offer, pricing, next steps"

### Key Message:
"This isn't a template. Every pitch is unique because it's based on their actual menu. Hillary walks in knowing exactly what dishes to mention."

---

## 🎤 Act 4: Voice Features - Hands-Free Operation

### Part A: Text-to-Speech

---

## 💾 Act 5: Persistence Demo - The Proof

### Setup:
"Now let me prove these notes aren't just session data. I'm going to shut down the server completely."

### What to Show:

**Step 1: Show Current Notes**
- Scroll to voice notes section
- "See these two notes we just recorded"

**Step 2: Exit the App**
- Go back to terminal
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
- "Server is completely down"

**Step 3: Restart Everything**
```bash
./start_app.sh
```
- "Fresh server start - no data in memory"

**Step 4: Navigate Back to Same Restaurant**
- Search "Evanston, IL" again
- Find the same restaurant (Prairie Moon or whichever you used)
- Click "View Pitch"
- Scroll to "📝 Notes" section

**Step 5: The Magic Moment**
- **"Look - our voice notes are still here!"**
- Same timestamps
- Same transcriptions
- Nothing lost

### Talking Points:

"This is localStorage in action:
- Notes saved in the browser, not the server
- Survives server restarts
- Survives browser restarts
- Survives computer restarts
- Only clears if Hillary explicitly clears browser data

This means Hillary can visit 20 restaurants Monday, come back Friday, and her notes are still there. Long-term follow-up tracking built-in."

### Key Message:
"This isn't a toy demo feature. This is production-grade persistence using browser native storage. Zero infrastructure cost."

---

## 🔄 Act 6: Pitch Refinement - Situational Adaptation

### Setup:
"Now let me show you something powerful - pitch refinement for different audiences."

### What to Show:

**Step 1: Navigate to Refinement Screen**
- Scroll to bottom of original pitch
- Click **"Refine This Pitch →"** button
- "Notice we're on a new screen - mobile-friendly, no endless scrolling"

**Step 2: Choose a Persona**
- Show the 3 options:
  - 🧑‍🍳 Chef / Kitchen Staff
  - 👔 Owner / Manager
  - 🎯 Host / Front Desk
- Click **"🎯 Host / Front Desk"**

**Step 3: Show the Refined Pitch**
- Refined pitch generates (2-3 seconds)
- **Point to TTS button at top:** "Notice - listen button right at the top"
- Click **"🔊 Listen to Refined Pitch"**
- Play it briefly

**Step 4: Compare**
- "This version is ultra-short - 30 seconds max"
- "Respectful, just trying to get past front desk to reach the chef"
- "Completely different tone from the original"

**Step 5: Try Another Persona**
- Click **"← Try Different Persona"**
- Select **"🧑‍🍳 Chef / Kitchen Staff"**
- Show refined pitch appears
- "Now it's technical - talks about melt points, cooking techniques"
- "Same data, completely different lens"

**Step 6: Return to Original**
- Click **"← Back to Original Pitch"**
- "Clean navigation - we're back where we started"

### Talking Points:

**The Problem:**
"Hillary might talk to the host first (gatekeeper), then the chef, then maybe the manager. Each person needs a different pitch."

**The Solution:**
"Three refinement templates - one click, instant adaptation:
- **Gatekeeper:** 30 seconds, get past front desk
- **Chef:** Technical, culinary peer-to-peer
- **Manager:** Business ROI, margins, menu differentiation"

**Not Regenerating:**
"We're not generating from scratch - we're applying a 'style filter' to reshape the existing pitch. That's why it's fast and cheap."

**Cost:**
- Original pitch: $0.05
- Each refinement: +$0.02
- Most restaurants don't need refinement
- Hillary only uses it when the situation requires

**Mobile-First Architecture:**
"Two separate pages - no endless scrolling on mobile:
- Page 1: Original pitch, TTS, voice notes
- Page 2: Refinement screen, persona selection
- Clean navigation, focused purpose"

### Key Message:
"This is situational intelligence. Hillary walks up, assesses who she's talking to, and pulls out the right version of the pitch. Real-world flexibility built into the system."

---

## ✨ Act 7: Micro-Refinements - Polishing the Perfect Pitch

### Setup:
"Now let me show you how Hillary can polish this pitch even further with one-click adjustments."

### What to Show:

**Step 1: After Persona Refinement**
- You should be on Page 2 with a refined pitch displayed (from Act 6)
- Scroll down below the refined pitch text
- **Point to the 5 buttons:**
  - 📏 Shorten
  - 📖 Expand
  - 💬 More Casual
  - 🎩 More Formal
  - ⚡ Strong Opener

**Step 2: Apply Shorten**
- Click **"📏 Shorten"**
- Watch loading indicator (2-3 seconds)
- **New pitch appears** - significantly condensed
- "Notice - same key points, but now 20-30 seconds max"
- Click **"🔊 Listen to Refined Pitch"** to hear the difference

**Step 3: Show Another Micro-Refinement**
- Click **"⚡ Strong Opener"**
- Loading indicator again
- **Pitch updates** with punchy opening line
- "Look at that first sentence - grabs attention immediately"

**Step 4: Multiple Refinements Stack**
- "We just applied TWO micro-refinements to the same pitch"
- "Each one builds on the previous version"
- "Hillary can keep refining until it's perfect"

### Talking Points:

**The Problem:**
"A chef-focused pitch might be good, but maybe Hillary needs it shorter, or maybe the opening isn't punchy enough."

**The Solution:**
"Five one-click micro-refinements that polish specific aspects:
- **Shorten:** Condense to 20-30 seconds (time-limited situation)
- **Expand:** Add detail and stories (engaged listener)
- **More Casual:** Friendly, conversational tone
- **More Formal:** Professional polish
- **Strong Opener:** Hook them in first sentence"

**Cost Structure:**
- Initial pitch: $0.05
- Persona refinement: $0.02
- Each micro-refinement: $0.01
- **Typical workflow:** Generate → Refine → 1-2 micro-adjustments = ~$0.08 total

**Why This Matters:**
"Hillary can perfect the pitch iteratively without starting over. Each refinement is focused and fast."

## 💾 Act 8: Save & Reuse - Zero-Cost Return Visits

### Setup:
"Now watch what happens when Hillary perfects a pitch and wants to save it for later."

### Part A: Saving a Pitch

**Step 1: Save Current Pitch**
- Still on Page 2 with refined pitch displayed
- Scroll to bottom below micro-refinement buttons
- Click **"💾 Save This Version"**
- **Success message appears:** "✅ Pitch saved! You can reload this anytime."
- Shows: "Saved for: 🧑‍🍳 Chef/Kitchen Staff"

**Step 2: Navigate Away**
- Click **"← Back to Original Pitch"**
- Go back to restaurant list
- Select a different restaurant
- "We've moved on - left that restaurant behind"

### Part B: Loading a Saved Pitch

**Step 3: Return to Same Restaurant**
- Go back to restaurant list
- Find the restaurant where we saved the pitch
- Click "View Pitch"
- **Original pitch screen loads**

**Step 4: Saved Pitch Indicator**
- Scroll down on Page 1
- **Point to the green box:** "💾 Saved Pitches Available!"
- Shows: "You have saved pitches for: Chef/Kitchen Staff"
- "Hillary immediately knows she has saved work here"

**Step 5: Go to Refinement Screen**
- Click **"Refine This Pitch →"** button
- Navigate to Page 2

**Step 6: Saved Pitch Cards**
- **Point to saved pitch section at top:**
  - Shows persona icon: 🧑‍🍳 Chef/Kitchen Staff
  - Shows timestamp: "Saved: Feb 18, 2026 9:45 AM"
  - Shows button: **"📖 Load This Pitch"**

**Step 7: Load the Saved Pitch**

- TTS button ready at top
- Micro-refinement buttons available if she wants to adjust further

### Part C: Multiple Personas

**Step 8: Save a Second Persona**
- Click **"← Try Different Persona"**
- Select **"👔 Owner / Manager"**
- Manager-focused pitch generates
- Optionally apply a micro-refinement
- Click **"💾 Save This Version"**
- **Success message:** "Saved for: 👔 Owner/Manager"

**Step 9: Show Both Saved Pitches**
- Navigate away and come back to same restaurant
- Go to Page 2 refinement screen
- **Two saved pitch cards now appear:**
  1. 🧑‍🍳 Chef/Kitchen Staff (Saved: 9:45 AM)
  2. 👔 Owner/Manager (Saved: 10:12 AM)
- "Hillary can load either one depending on who she's talking to"

### Talking Points:

**The Problem:**
"Hillary might get turned away the first time. Manager isn't available. She needs to come back. But she doesn't want to pay $0.05 to regenerate the same pitch."

**The Solution:**
"Save perfected pitches to localStorage:
- Load instantly on return visits ($0 API cost)
- Multiple personas per restaurant
- Persists across browser restarts, server restarts
- Indicator on Page 1 shows saved pitches exist"

**Cost Comparison:**
- **Without save feature:**
  - Visit 1: Generate ($0.05)
  - Visit 2: Regenerate ($0.05)
  - Visit 3: Regenerate ($0.05)
  - **Total: $0.15**
- **With save feature:**
  - Visit 1: Generate + refine + save ($0.08)
  - Visit 2: Load saved ($0)
  - Visit 3: Load saved ($0)
  - **Total: $0.08 — saves $0.07**

**Real-World Scenario:**
"Hillary visits 'Oceanique' Monday morning, pitches to host, gets turned away.
Tuesday afternoon, manager is there - she loads saved 'Manager' pitch instantly.
Friday evening, she catches the chef - loads saved 'Chef' pitch instantly.
One generation fee, three visits."

**Long-Term Follow-Ups:**
"These pitches persist for weeks, months. If a restaurant says 'come back in 3 months when our supplier contract expires', Hillary's pitch is still there waiting."

**Multi-Persona Strategy:**
"Save different versions:
- **Gatekeeper pitch** for getting past front desk
- **Chef pitch** for culinary conversation
- **Manager pitch** for business ROI discussion
Each one optimized, polished, ready to deploy"

### Key Message:
"This isn't just a cost optimization - it's a workflow optimization. Hillary perfects the pitch once, reuses it forever. That's production-grade thinking."

## 💡 Closing Talking Points

### Business Value Summary:
"Let's talk ROI:
- **Time saved:** Hillary doesn't waste visits on incompatible restaurants
- **Money saved:** $0.05 per avoided pitch (Asian detection) + $0.05-0.08 per return visit (saved pitches)
- **Better outcomes:** Contextual pitches based on real menu data, refined for specific audiences
- **Pitch perfection:** Iterative refinement with micro-adjustments until it's exactly right
- **Long-term memory:** Voice notes + rejection learning + saved pitches compound over time
- **Zero-cost returns:** Load perfected pitches instantly on follow-up visits

This isn't AI for AI's sake. This is AI solving a real cold-weather problem for a real cheese business."

### Technical Sophistication Hidden Behind Simplicity:
"Under the hood:
- 3-layer filtering system (backend keywords, rejection memory, pre-pitch detection)
- Claude Haiku for fast filtering ($0.001)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 for pitch generation ($0.02)
- Google Places for menu data ($0.032)
- Persona-based refinement templates ($0.02)
- Micro-refinement prompts ($0.01 each)
- Web Speech API for free TTS and voice notes
- localStorage for zero-infrastructure persistence (pitches + notes)
- 2-page mobile-first architecture for clean UX

**Cost breakdown per prospect:**
- Initial pitch: $0.05
- Persona refinement: $0.02
- Micro-refinements: $0.01-0.02
- Load saved pitch: $0 (localStorage)
**Typical first visit: $0.08 | Return visits: $0**"

### What We'd Improve Next:
"Week 1 priorities if Hillary starts using this:
1. Route optimization - sort by walking distance from current location
2. Success tracking - mark which pitches converted to sales
3. Batch overnight - pre-generate pitches for tomorrow's planned route

Month 1:
- Semantic filtering - embeddings to catch more edge cases
- Collaborative learning - share rejection data across reps
- Export to CSV - share prospect list with team

This is an MVP that works today, with a clear roadmap for scaling when the business proves the model."

## 🎤 Suggested Voice Note Examples

Use realistic, business-focused content:

**Successful Visit:**
- "Spoke with head chef Sarah, she loved the Pasture Bloom sample, placing initial order Monday for 5 pounds"

**Follow-Up Needed:**
